      "p1": "Christmas is a special time. Every year, we celebrate the birth of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ. After the fall of Adam and Eve, the people of God were waiting for the Messiah, the chosen one, who would become the king of Israel and lead them. For many years, God prepared His faithful to welcome the Messiah, and one night, in a place called Bethlehem, the promised one, Christ was born.",
      "p2": "The whole story of the Old Testament is about preparation to meet Jesus. The narratives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph tell us something about Christ. On this website, you can prepare to meet baby Jesus on the day of His birth."
