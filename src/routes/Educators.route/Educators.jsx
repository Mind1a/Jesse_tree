        This resource is structured for children of elementary school age. It
        intends to help children to think about Christ during the celebration of
        Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The materials are divided into six weeks. Each week, the students hear
        passages from the Old Testament and try to connect them with the person
        of Christ. Using short Hymnography texts, the educators will try to link
        the passages of the OT with the reality of Christian tradition.
      </p>

        The resource can work in different settings. Church school educators can
        use it for weekly sessions during Advent. It is recommended that the
        students read the passages appointed for the following session during
        the week and prepare for the meetings by spending a few minutes a day
        with their parents, reading a few verses from the scripture. But if it’s
        impossible, the educator can tell the biblical stories during the
        session. If the church school is equipped with a monitor or a projector,
        the resource could be used in digital form, but if the educator doesn’t
        have proper technologies or prefers to plan the sessions without using
        any electronics, the illustration and the texts could be printed out and
        then distributed during the class.

        Parents can use our Jesse Tree reading materials at home for weekly or
        daily sessions with their children.

        Usage of the scriptural texts is up to the educators. In our materials,
        we included the references to the chapters and verses. The educators can
        choose the best translation that suits their context or paraphrase to
        tell the stories.
